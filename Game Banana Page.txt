This helper is designed to be a collection of new mechanics based on suggestions from the community, as well as a place to put any random ideas that we have. If you have any ideas for new mechanics/entities that you want to see implemented, let us know, and if it sounds cool/doable we'll add it to the collection. You can find us in the [Celeste Discord](https://discord.gg/g8Mw3XH) @Bio and @catapillie.

The current list of included mechanics:
* Connected Dream Block - Dream blocks that when placed such that they overlap, will form continuous regions. The "feather mode" option allows the player to control their direction of movement while traveling through the block, and the "one use" option will cause the dream block to shatter upon exit.
* Dream Zip Mover, Move Block, Swap Block and Falling Block - As the name suggests, each of these entities take the movement behaviour of a specific solid, and apply it to a dream block. These entities all have access to the same "feather mode" and "one use" options as the Connected Dream Block. The Dream Zip Mover and Swap Block both have access to "no return" modes, and the Dream Move Block has access to the "no collide" mode, which will allow it to pass through any solids other than Dream Blocks while moving.
* Dream Refill - A special refill that once collected, allows the player to dash through any solid, except for dream blocks which will kill them.
* Cassette Zip Mover, Move Block, Swap Block and Falling Block - Similar to the dream block types above, each of these entities take the movement behaviour of a specific solid, and apply it to a cassette block. The Cassette Zip Mover and Swap Block both have access to "no return" modes.
* Station Block and Tracks - A block that sits on a track, and when activated will move along the track to a specific node. The block is activated by dashing into it, and will either move toward the side that was dashed into, or away from it, based on the "behaviour" option. Track segments are either vertical or horizontal, and when placed such that their nodes (ends) overlap, will connect to form full, continuous tracks. The block must be placed directly on top of a track node for it to attach to the track, and when activated can only move in directions that have a track segment leading away from their current node, in that direction.
* Synced Zip Mover Activation Controller - A controller entity that when placed into a room allows Synced Zip Movers (from the [Adventure Helper](https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/9807)) of a specific color to activate whenever the player pressed grab.
* Attached Wall Booster - A wall booster that can be attached to a moving solid.
