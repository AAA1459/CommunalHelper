    anything in [] should be changed to fit the needs of the user and not taken literally.
    Vector2 formatting is always in the form [integer],[integer] (in other words, no decimal points)
    You can only have 1 PlayerVisualModification per file.
    You do not need an Image or Sprite for the modifications to work.

    <PlayerOffset>0,-3</PlayerOffset> <!-- This is the offset, in pixels, the player will be relative to its hitbox. -->
<!-- The last instance of Image or Sprite tags will always take priority. -->
    <Image offset="3,0">pathFromGameplayAtlas</Image> 
<!-- offset refers to the *default* image offset. If a sprite animation requires a different offset, that can be set in the Override parameters -->
    <Sprite name="[spriteID]" offset="2,2"/> <!-- spriteID should be from the "vanilla" sprites.xml, in other words, the common SpriteBank (Graphics/Sprites.xml) can be used here -->

<!-- alternatively, you can build your own sprite in here directly. It will be put in CommunalHelper's SpriteBank, so you can *not* access it from the common spritebank.
This is done as if you were writing it into the common SpriteBank (or any other xml-based SpriteBank), with one difference.
Instead of starting with any string as the Tag name, you put the "Tag" name in the name parameter. This will go into CommunalHelper's SpriteBank @ "PVI/[nameOfSprite]".
This example is equivalent to "granny" in the Common SpriteBank.
Note that you need a UNIQUE identifier, to both PlayerVisualModifiers *and* the Common SpriteBank.
Example being: using <Sprite name="granny" ...> would fail here. -->
