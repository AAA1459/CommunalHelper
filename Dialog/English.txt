		{# 856bff}Dream Zip Movers{#}, {# 856bff}Dream Swap Blocks{#} and {# 856bff}Dream Move Blocks{#} are zip movers, swap blocks or move blocks...
		
		[MADELINE normal left]
		... But they act like dream blocks!

		The {# 856bff}Dream Refill{#}, once consumed, allows you to dash through any kind of solid, except for dream blocks, which will kill you.
		{+THOUGHT}They also give your dash back, of course!{+ENDTHOUGHT}

		{# 856bff}Connected Dream Blocks{#}, when placed so that they overlap, will combine to form continuous regions.
		
	communalhelper_trailer_04=
	
		[MADELINE normal left]
		Optionally, you can turn on Feather Mode, which will allow you to control your direction of movement while moving through the block.
		
	communalhelper_trailer_05=
	
		[MADELINE normal left]
		Since {# 856bff}Connected Dream Blocks{#} are a group of overlapping rectangles...
		...you can optionally turn on the "One Use" mode for any rectangle you want, and the entire Dream Block will shatter if you exit it from the one use rectangles.
