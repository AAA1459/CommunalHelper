This helper is designed to be a collection of new mechanics based on suggestions from the community, as well as a place to put any random ideas that I have. If you have any ideas for new mechanics/entities that you want to see implemented, let me know, and if it sounds cool/doable I'll add it to the collection. You can find me in the [Celeste Discord](https://discord.gg/g8Mw3XH) @Bio.

The current list of included mechanics:

    Dream Zip Mover - The body of a Zip Mover with the soul of a Dream Block.
    Dream Move Block - Move Block by day, Dream Block by night.
    Dream Swap Block - I think you get the idea.
