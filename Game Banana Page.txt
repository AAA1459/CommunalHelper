This helper is designed to be a collection of new mechanics based on suggestions from the community, as well as a place to put any random ideas that I have. If you have any ideas for new mechanics/entities that you want to see implemented, let me know, and if it sounds cool/doable I'll add it to the collection. You can find me in the [Celeste Discord](https://discord.gg/g8Mw3XH) @Bio.

The current list of included mechanics:

    Dream Zip Mover - The body of a Zip Mover with the soul of a Dream Block.
    Dream Move Block - Move Block by day, Dream Block by night.
    Dream Swap Block - I think you get the idea.
    Connected Dream Block - Dream Blocks that nicely connect together, if they overlap, to make up any shape. They can also shatter after use if enabled, and they can optionally let you move inside as if you had a feather.
